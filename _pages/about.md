I am a post-doctoral scholar at Caltech/IPAC, working with Dr. [Yun Wang](http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/wang/). Before moving to the west coast, I obtained my PhD from the Department of Physics at New York University, under the supervision of Prof. Michael Blanton and Prof. Jeremy Tinker. 

I am interested in many aspects of cosmology and astrophysics, including but not limited to large scale structure, galaxy clustering, dark matter & dark energy, early universe, galaxy formation and evolution. My research works can be found from the Research page.

I was born in Shizuishan, a city in the north of Ningxia Province. It is a small city but I am sure it is different than any other cities in China.

My name is written as "翟忠旭" in Chinese characters (last name first). The first character of my given name "忠" (Zhong) means loyalty, following my family tree. The second character "旭" (Xu) means the sun in the morning.
